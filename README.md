Musician and computer enthusiast since childhood. Before deciding to dedicate myself to play the bandoneon full time I had begun to study systems analysis and programming, now I'm returning to this exciting world.
I'm also interested in exchanging languages, currently learning french and perfecting my english, so if you are in the process of learning spanish we can practice together.

👀 I'm interested in web design,algorithms, logic programming, data bases. Exchanging languages (french, english).
🌱 I'm currently learning JavaScript, React, GIT, HTML5 y CSS.
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate in projects that help me to learning.
